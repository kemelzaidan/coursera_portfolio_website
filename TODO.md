You are to extend one of the two examples we have explored so far - EITHER the portfolio website with blog, OR the collaborative music making web app, in order to produce a simple, yet usable, finished website. Your website must take advantage of dynamic content creation.

Your website must extend the example, adding design, content and purpose in the case of the portfolio website (either fictional or based on a real clientâ€™s requirements), and adding collaborative music making features in the case of the web application.

The site can have any number of pages as long as there is a clear purpose for each one. It must have the following features.

1. Clear navigation allowing the user to move between pages and locate relevant information
2. Consistent style across the pages through the use of CSS
3. Responsive layout where the layout changes depending on the size of the browser window
4. Use of Bootstrap
5. Clearly stated purpose for each page
6. Clear landing page
7. ONLY If you are making the portfolio website: it should contain no less than 10 posts in addition to any static content. It should also contain at least three video links and 6 still images.
